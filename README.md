---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with Redux  
- **Backend**: Python Django

- **Authentication**: Django REST Framework  
- **Containerization**: Docker  

---

## Key Features
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- File Encryption
- Expirable Sharing Links
- Secure File Transfer
---

## Learnings
- Django REST Framework for API development.
- Leveraged Docker and Docker Compose for containerization.
- Implemented multi-factor authentication with TOTP and email verification.
   - Note: MFA is not enabled by default and MFA won't work if EMAIL_HOST_USER is not set.
- Implemented role-based access control for different user roles.
- Implemented file encryption and decryption

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+  
- Node.js 16+  
- Docker  
- Docker Compose

## Database Schema

#### **User Table**
- **Fields**:  
  - `id`: Primary key, auto-incremented.  
  - `email`: Unique email address of the user.  
  - `username`: Username chosen by the user.  
  - `first_name`: First name of the user.  
  - `last_name`: Last name of the user.  
  - `selected_drive`: Tracks the userâ€™s currently active drive.

---

#### **File Table**
- **Fields**:  
  - `id`: Primary key, auto-incremented.  
  - `owner`: Foreign key linking to the `User` table (represents the file owner).  
  - `filename`: Name of the uploaded file.  
  - `file`: Encrypted file data stored in private storage.  
  - `mime_type`: MIME type of the file (e.g., `application/pdf`).  
  - `size`: Size of the file in bytes.  
  - `created_at`: Timestamp for file creation.  
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp for the last update.  
  - `encryption_key`: Binary field storing the encryption key (AES-256).  
  - `encryption_iv`: Binary field storing the initialization vector for encryption.  
  - `encryption_tag`: Binary field storing the GCM tag for verification.  
  - `added_by`: Foreign key linking to the `User` table, tracking who added the file (optional).

---

#### **SharedFile Table**
- **Fields**:  
  - `id`: Primary key, auto-incremented.  
  - `file`: Foreign key linking to the `File` table.  
  - `sender_user`: Foreign key linking to the `User` table (represents the user sharing the file).  
  - `receiver_email`: Email of the user with whom the file is shared.  
  - `access_type`: Access permission type (`view`, `download`, `edit`).  
  - `message`: Optional message shared along with the file.  
  - `created_at`: Timestamp for when the file was shared.  
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp for the last update.  
  - `shared_by`: Foreign key linking to the `User` table, tracking who shared the file (optional).

---

#### **PublicFile Table**
- **Fields**:  
  - `id`: Primary key, auto-incremented.  
  - `uuid`: Unique identifier for the public file link.  
  - `file`: One-to-one relationship with the `File` table.  
  - `is_active`: Boolean field indicating whether the link is active.  
  - `expiration_date`: Date and time when the public link expires (optional).  
  - `created_at`: Timestamp for link creation.  
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp for the last update.  
  - `shared_by`: Foreign key linking to the `User` table, tracking who created the public link (optional).

---

#### **DriveAccess Table**
- **Fields**:  
  - `id`: Primary key, auto-incremented.  
  - `owner`: Foreign key linking to the `User` table (represents the owner of the drive).  
  - `receiver_email`: Email of the user who is granted access to the drive.  
  - `role`: Role assigned to the receiver (`admin`, `editor`, `viewer`).  
  - `created_at`: Timestamp for when the access was granted.  
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp for the last update.  
  - `added_by`: Foreign key linking to the `User` table, tracking who added the drive access (optional).

### **Logic**

1. **Drive Access Logic:**  
   - Each user is allowed to create their own drive.  
   - The `DriveAccess` table uses a combination of `receiver_email` and `owner` fields to manage drive access.  
   - This design allows the owner to invite other users by their email, even if the invited users are not yet registered in the system.  
   - When the invited user registers, they automatically gain access to the drive based on the existing `DriveAccess` entry and invited user can also have user's own drive.

2. **File Sharing Logic:**  
   - The `SharedFile` table allows sharing files using the `receiver_email` field.  
   - This means files can be shared with users who are not yet registered in the system.  
   - Once the receiver registers, they can see the files shared with them using their email.  
   - This approach ensures that file sharing is seamless and does not depend on the receiver being an existing user of the system or the drive.

3. **Role-Based Access Control:**  
   - In the `DriveAccess` table, the `role` field (`admin`, `editor`, `viewer`) defines the type of permissions granted to a user for a particular drive.  
   - Similarly, in the `SharedFile` table, the `access_type` field (`view`, `download`, `edit`) defines the level of access granted for a specific file.

4. **Public File Sharing Logic:**  
   - The `PublicFile` table generates a unique `uuid` for each public link.  
   - Public links can be dynamically generated and shared, with an optional expiration date to ensure time-limited access.  
   - The `is_active` field ensures control over whether a public link is currently usable.  

This combination of logic ensures flexibility, scalability, and seamless collaboration between registered and unregistered users.
